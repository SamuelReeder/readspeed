    text: 'Pride and Prejudice is an 1813 novel of manners written by Jane Austen. The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Mr. Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming very poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well to support the others, which is a motivation that drives the plot.',

Mankind emerges from Pascal\'s analysis as a wretched and desolate creature within an impersonal universe, but also as a being whose existence can be transformed through faith in God\'s grace.

Through dialogue, three fictional characters named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of God\'s existence. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God\'s nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity. In the Dialogues, Hume\'s characters debate a number of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the argument from design -- for which Hume uses the example of a house -- and whether there is more suffering or good in the world.',
